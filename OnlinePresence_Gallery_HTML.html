	<p>Beyond studying and working, my personal time mostly revolves around some extent of games. Whether it is designing games of my own, playing RPG's with my friends, or booting up my computer for a late-night game session, the world of games extends beyond a simple pastime into a devoted passion of mine.</p>
    
    <p>My passions for games stem from designing games as a hobby. From a very young age, one of my favorite things to do would be to let my imagination run free, and then design a game around it. While most games were impulsive, spur-of-the-moment decisions from my end, each successive game shaped my identity as a game designer, and even taught me things along the way.</p>
    
    <p>After a while, I also began to contribute fanmade concepts to existing games I was a fan of. What started as one-off Pokemon card designs has now branched into the game of Magic: The Gathering, whose custom community I am an active member of. It is refreshing and often challenging to try to contribute new and unique designs to an existing environment, while accounting for the existing balance and design philosophy of that environment.</p>
    
    <p>I like to think that my passion for games has given me some skills in life. My incentive to create and innovate in my own head shaped me as a child to take more risks, which has stayed true up until this point. My commitment and motivation in projects was improved, thanks to the commitments I made at home with my own projects. My outgoing nature was largely inspired by meeting likeminded people, who were eager and interested in my projects, and I still try to surround myself with such people to this day.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, I feel like my identity over the years has been shaped by my will to become a designer. While I am still working to achieve those goals, I feel like my accumulated experience, hobbies, and personality are a great fit for a designer.</p>
